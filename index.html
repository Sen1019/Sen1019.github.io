<p id = "elevator_pitch">I love to learn new things.<br/>
    I have recently left my job as a prosthetics technician, where I built artificial limbs, to pursue a career as a software developer.  
    While I enjoyed the inital problem solving and creativity of being a technician, I found that it did not provide me with the consistent growth and challenge that I crave.
    I look forward the future of building and maintenance that is possible in software development.
